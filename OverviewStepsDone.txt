Overview of steps done:

- Configure Services and endpoints.
- Add Model matching Order properties;
- Create database via migrations;
- Implement CRUD actions and respective razor pages;
- Implement files parser:
	- on button "Import Orders via Files";
	- respecting the requirement to be escalable and have in mind different files types can be used to import Orders;
	- using appSettings and DI to know directory of files and pattern;
	- make parsing action async to not block the UI
- Add validations;
- Add Unit Tests for Controller and Service -> More coverage could have been done, but I believe it already shows enough about working with MSTests and Moq;
- Publish Web App;
